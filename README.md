Run `./doThatThing.sh`. Builds and runs test, then runs WordCountApp with the file 'someText.txt'.

Please note:
- Case sensitive, i.e. 'Go' and 'go' are treated as different words
- Leading and trailing punctuations are removed, but not punctuations in the middle of a word
- `' '`, `'\t'`, `'\r'`, `'\n'` are treated as white space
